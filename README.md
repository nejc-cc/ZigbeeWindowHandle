# ZigbeeWindowHandle
Ikea Parasoll turned into a smart window handle

# Prerequities
Well, I made this work on my Home Assistant instance with Zigbee2MQTT addon. I guess this could be done with pretty much any Zigbee gateway really, the only downside is that you need to be able to invert payload that you get from modified Ikea Parasoll sensor: open is now closed and vice-versa.

## You also need these:
- Ikea Parasoll sensor
- AAA battery (can be Ikea rechargeable)
- microswitch with lever
- 6 x 6 x 4,3 mm microswitch (optional but highly recommended)
- transparent (PLA/PETG/ABS/ASA...) filament
- any other filament color
- longer shaft (about 1 cm longer than original)
- longer screws (for this project original screws were 1 cm too short as well)
